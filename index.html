  <h2><u>Where:</u>
    <p>Owls live in a variety of habitats, including coniferous forests, mountains, deserts, and plains.
      The snowy owl lives in the cold tundra of the north. Owls nest in a variety of ways. Several species, such as great gray and great horned owls, live in old hawk or squirrel nests.</p>

  <h3><u>Diet and Food Chain:</u>
<p>
People also ask
What is the food chain for a owl?
All owls are predators; they depend on other animals for food. However, very few predators feed on owls (except sometimes other owls). In fact, owls often eat other predators, such as weasels, bats, shrews and insect-eating birds. Therefore, owls hold a position at the top of the food chain.

  <h4><u>Fun Facts:</u>
    <p>
     <ul>
       <li>Many owl species have asymmetrical ears.</li>
       <li>The eyes of an owl are not true “eyeballs.” Their tube-shaped eyes are completely immobile, providing binocular vision which fully focuses on their prey and boosts depth perception.</li>
       <li>Owls can rotate their necks 270 degrees.</li>
     </ul>
